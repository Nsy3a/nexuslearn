# Contributing to NexusLearn

First off, thank you for considering contributing to NexusLearn! It's people like you that make NexusLearn such a great community. We welcome any form of contribution, from reporting bugs and proposing new features to submitting pull requests.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please make sure to [open an issue](https://github.com/Nsy3a/nexuslearn/issues/new?template=bug_report.md). Try to include as much information as you can, such as the steps to reproduce the bug, the expected behavior, and the actual behavior.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Nsy3a/nexuslearn/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate our efforts and prevent duplicating work.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to NexusLearn? You can start by looking through `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Good First Issues](https://github.com/Nsy3a/nexuslearn/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help Wanted Issues](https://github.com/Nsy3a/nexuslearn/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issues`.
