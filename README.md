[中文版-Chinese Version](./README.zh.md)

**NexusLearn** is a revolutionary, self-evolving decentralized learning ecosystem driven by the synergy of AI and community collaboration. Our vision is to break down knowledge barriers, transforming individual quests for knowledge into reusable public intellectual wealth through an innovative economic model.

> **Core Vision**: To build a world where every participant is a learner, contributor, and beneficiary, collectively creating and sharing knowledge.

## Core Philosophy

- **Human-AI Synergy**: A dual-driven evolution. Humans provide initial needs, creativity, and feedback, while AI handles requirement analysis, content generation, path planning, and system optimization.
- **Knowledge as a Public Good**: Paid, customized solutions are standardized and minted as **Knowledge NFTs**, becoming part of a public repository accessible to all community members for free.
- **Quantifiable Contribution**: Leveraging Web3.0, all contributions—from providing quality materials to answering questions—are recorded on-chain and rewarded fairly through a tokenized economy.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Personalized Learning**: AI agents like the "Path Planner" and "Academic Research Assistant" create tailored learning journeys for users.
- **Decentralized Knowledge Warehouse**: Utilizes **IPFS** for permanent, censorship-resistant storage of multimodal educational content.
- **Tokenized Economy ($NEXL)**: A native token for governance, payments, staking, and rewarding community contributions.
- **Knowledge NFTs**: Finalized, community-generated solutions are minted as NFTs, with ownership belonging to the community DAO.
- **AI-Powered Community**: AI facilitates collaboration by breaking down complex requests, matching them with experts, and integrating the best solutions.

## Technology Stack (Planned)

- **Frontend**: Next.js / React, Tailwind CSS, Ethers.js
- **AI Core**: Python, LangChain / LlamaIndex, FastAPI
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, Hardhat, OpenZeppelin
- **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB

## System Architecture

The system is designed in a layered architecture:

1.  **Frontend Layer**: A highly customizable UI that adapts to user profiles.
2.  **AI Core Layer**: A "decentralized intelligent brain" composed of pluggable AI microservices.
3.  **Data & Protocol Layer**: Includes the distributed knowledge warehouse (IPFS), user behavior analysis, and the blockchain protocol for governance and value transfer.

## Roadmap

> This is a high-level roadmap and is subject to change based on community feedback.

- **Phase 1: Foundation & Community Building (Q3 2024)**
  - [ ] Release initial whitepaper.
  - [ ] Launch official website and community channels (GitHub Discussions, Discord).
  - [ ] Develop core smart contracts for the $NEXL token and NFTs.
- **Phase 2: MVP Launch (Q4 2024)**
  - [ ] Launch MVP with core features: AI-powered learning path generation and basic knowledge warehouse.
  - [ ] Implement initial tokenomics and reward system.
- **Phase 3: Ecosystem Expansion (2025)**
  - [ ] Introduce DAO governance.
  - [ ] Expand AI agent capabilities.
  - [ ] Foster third-party developer ecosystem.

## Getting Started

> **Note**: The project is currently in the conceptual design phase. The following steps are a placeholder for when the first codebase is released.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.x
- Yarn or npm
- A crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nsy3a/nexuslearn.git
    cd nexuslearn
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Configure your environment. Create a `.env.local` file from the `.env.example`:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```
    *Fill in the necessary environment variables (e.g., IPFS gateway, blockchain node URL).*

4.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
